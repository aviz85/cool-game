# Cool Game

Welcome to the Cool Game! This game is all about having fun, enjoying a good time, and of course, becoming the Cool Game Champion.

In this game, the computer will think of a random number between 1 and 100. Your job is to guess what that number is. If you guess too low, the computer will tell you 'Too low'. If you guess too high, you'll hear 'Too high'. When you guess the right number, you'll become the Cool Game Champion.

Have fun, enjoy the game, and keep being cool!

Note: This is a simple game written in Python. If you're new to Python, this is a great place to start. If you're an experienced Python developer, feel free to add new features or improve the code.
